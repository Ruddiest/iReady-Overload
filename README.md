# iReady-Overload
iReady is awful. It's the worst education tool anyone could ever use. I'm fed up with being forced to mindlessly watch the result of a greedy corporation that doesn't try in any way to make their product enjoyable, or even acceptable, for an hour and a half every single week.
This repository is a collection of hacks that ensure nobody has to suffer through iReady ever again. The current version has a [lesson and quiz skipper](lessonSkipper/), [minutes hack](minutesHack/), and an experimental [diagnostic hack](diagnosticHack/). There is also a [lesson viewer](lessonViewer/) that can show you the lesson data and files of many iReady lessons. You can view older versions of hacks [here](olderVersions/). There is also a [Chrome extension](chromeExtension.zip) that makes using these hacks a lot easier. It is an unpackaged extension, meaning you can install it like [this](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/).
